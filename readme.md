# Ideas & Notes:

- We should aim to make these documents student AND instructor facing

- Any non-student facing details can be included in YAML front matter

- We should decide on heading levels. I think heading levels should err more towards making content readable on github, which to me looks like sections of the lesson being h2s. That lets the title be h1, and the pre-lesson stuff can be h3s to stand out. But h2's give us an underline to visually break up each section & make it more readable.

- If README.md was lowercase, it would save having to remember to uppercase when in terminal, which is only a few seconds, but less annoying over time

- We could auto-generate timing tables after the fact. The least distracting hierarchically is to include them in the headings themselves

- It might be easiest to estimate time in increments of 5 minutes. It's doubtful any timing will be exact, so rounding to 5 minute increments might just make it easier to guess

- What happens when there's no real start or solution code, just code we need to play with in the lesson? 

- Dashes or underscores? I made the case in the handbook for dashes – at the very least, it matches how url slugs look. It also lets you jump between words pretty consistently in terminal & text editors; underscores count as one whole word in some environments, so it's harder to get to the connector

- We should probably come up with default names for folders & main files: css/style.css, js/app.js?

- Also, consistent image sizes & example screenshot setups - 500px wide? I have no idea, just something visible in a readme.

- I guess all of this is making me start thinking we should document an actual style guide.
